# 80leg JSON to CSV Parse and Convert

This program works in conjuction with the 80legs Web Crawler app and is not meant to be used on its own. To use this program you must first run an web crawl using the email collector 80app. The results of that crawl will be stored in a downloadable JSON file. This program will take the location of the JSON file as input then parse any emails found within the JSON file and write them to a CSV file.

The JSON file location should be formatted as **C:\path\to\file** for Windows and **path/to/file** for Mac
